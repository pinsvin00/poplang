# poplang
My own intepreted language, it's barely stable and doesn't support much thing at the time, but hopefully in the nearest future I will upgrade it to the level that will satisfy me : ).
The biggest success i've managed to make with this language is to make erastothenes sieve in this language.

What currently works in poplang?
- For loops, if statements, but only if AST builder has a good mood.
- Arithmetic operations (+-/*%)
- Basic operations on arrays, this is adding, check the size, and taking the nth element.

# What doesn't work in poplang?
- Parentheses in arithmetic operations
- Functions
- Printing string literals
- Proper error handling
- And many other things that I haven't discovered yet : )
