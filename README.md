# poplang
My own intepreted language, it's barely stable and doesn't support much thing at the time, but hopefully in the nearest future I will upgrade it to the level that will satisfy me : ).
The biggest success i've managed to make with this language is to make erastothenes sieve in this language.

What currently works in poplang?
- For loops, and other control instructions
- Arithmetic operations (+-/*%)
- Basic operations on arrays, this is adding, check the size, and taking the nth element.
- Functions
- Garbage Collection
- Channeling output to C++
