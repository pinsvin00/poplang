# poplang
My own intepreted language, it's barely stable and doesn't support much thing at the time, but hopefully in the nearest future I will upgrade it to the level that will satisfy me : ).
Feel free to contribute and to add any remarks and feature requests to issues tab, I will be insanely happy and I will surely look through it. 

What currently works in poplang?
- For loops, if/else if/else statements.
- Arithmetic operations (+-/*%)
- Basic operations on arrays, this is appending, check the size, and taking the nth element.
- Functions
